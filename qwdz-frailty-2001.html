FBI agent Wesley Doyle is startled by the spontaneous declaration of youngster Fenton Meiks about how his father's delusions to have a divine mission A fantastic movie , a must see for anyone who like their films toned dark  It is certainly the most convictional horror movie. It's dark, original , twisted , thought provoking and quite fun too at the same time. If you have not seen this yet, I highly encourage you to see this  Is it a popular movie in horror buffs. Actor Bill Paxton made his directorial debut with Frailty. The bulk of the story is told through flashbacks, as a mysterious man (Matthew McConaughey) tells a terrible tale to an FBI agent (Powers Boothe) investigating. 
I always feel this film doesn't get anywhere near as much attention as it should; it was well-received by critics, but it seems like the general public never got around to it. But I highly recommend you do. Not only is a showcase for Bill Paxton's talents as both an actor and a director (and makes you even more sad that he's gone), it has one of the best twists of any horror film I've ever seen. It really does put the entire movie up until then into a completely new perspective.

I've seen this film 8 or 10 times over the years. I have to admit, It took me 2 or 3, before I "got it". I love this movie! We've all seen the headlines from time to time, about some Asshole killing someone because "God told them to." What if.God really DID tell them to. That's what happens, (or not), to Bill Paxton's "Dad Meiks". His two Sons are part of it all. Great plot twists are revealed near the end. I did not see it coming. (I almost always do).

A man confesses to an FBI agent his family's story of how his religious fanatic father's visions I was thinking the story sounded like the Bill Paxton movie. Did some googling and found an article that said it was in fact loosely based on Kallinger, article (http://www.awfulhorrormovies.com/2014/11/frailty-2001.html?m=1). Frailty movie YIFY subtitles  The film is very complete in what it is, keeping one continuously interested with the flashbacks to childhood and growing up with such a bizarre father, and interspersing it with the tails of serial murder, one simply cannot go wrong. 
I base my list on a few important factors: The chase: To what lengths did I go to get the tape in my possession Timing: When certain stars have aligned and only you know it The gamble: You could have left with a safe bet but went with your gut The reward: When that trip to the video shop was only the start Here's my list 1.

I borrowed the VHS from my local library but you had to pay a 20p fee. You could keep the tapes for two whole weeks! Ben Kingsley was formidable and I knew I recognised Eckhart when Nolan used him later on. I think also having the video cassette and cover made me look forward to sitting and watching, after going to the effort of searching the library as well. This in contrast to the easy streaming of digital content where it's less of an event physically and the effort just isn't there. –£ –Ω–∞—Å —Ñ–∏–ª—å–º –ü–æ—Ä–æ–∫ / Frailty (2001) —Å–æ–≤–µ—Ä—à–µ–Ω–Ω–æ –±–µ—Å–ø–ª–∞—Ç–Ω–æ –≤ –∫–∞—á–µ—Å—Ç–≤–µ HD 1080. –§–∞–Ω—Ç–∞—Å—Ç–∏–∫–∞, –ë–æ–µ–≤–∏–∫–∏, –¢—Ä–∏–ª–ª–µ—Ä—ã. –ê–≥–µ–Ω—Ç –§–ë–† –£—ç—Å–ª–∏ –î–æ–π–ª –≤–æ–∑–≥–ª–∞–≤–ª—è–µ—Ç —Å–ª–µ–¥—Å—Ç–≤–∏–µ –ø–æ –¥–µ–ª—É —Ç–µ—Ö–∞—Å—Å–∫–æ–≥–æ.
